# My Isaac Lab Workspace

This is an external Isaac Lab workspace that depends on the main Isaac Lab repository: https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab.git

It was created to develop and train a locomotion controller using Reinforcement Learning with RSL-RL. The project follows the manager-based workflow from Isaac Lab to organize tasks, configurations, and training pipelines.

The final goal is to deploy the trained policy in Isaac Sim and integrate it with ROS 2 for real-time testing and control.
